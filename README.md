Question 1:

Move Zeroes
Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]

Constraints:
a. 1 <= nums.length <= 10^4
b. -2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1


Question 2:

First Unique Character in a String

Given a string s, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it does not exist, return -1.

Example 1:
Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: 0

Example 2:
Input: s = "loveleetcode"
Output: 2

Example 3:
Input: s = "aabb"
Output: -1

Constraints:
a. 1 <= s.length <= 10^5
b. s consists of only lowercase English letters.
